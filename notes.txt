where to hold state?

i'll probably maintain state and data in the top level parent component, but would it more more sense have child components pass data upward (lifting state)
and then doing the calculations? Or am I assuming correctly that I should hold state in the top level component and then just pass data down after calculations were made?  I guess when I get further I could test the efficiency of both but that refactor could be a big time sink

  doughnut SVG

radius is based on the circumference, basing everything off of a circumference of 100 just so numbers are simple, SVG's scale anyways
